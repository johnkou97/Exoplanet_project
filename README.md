# Project on exoplanets

The project uses `MESA` which needs to be installed if you want to run the simulations. More information can be found [here](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r23.05.1/). To run it use the folder `run_mesa` and follow the instructions of README inside the folder.

## Files
The project contains the following files:
- `visualization.ipynb`: notebook to create different plots based on the results of the simulations
- `catalog.csv`: catalog of exoplanets, obtained from [here](http://exoplanet.eu/)
- `report_1.pdf`: first report explaining the simulations and visualization plots.
- `report_2.pdf`: second report explaining the simulations and visualization plots.
